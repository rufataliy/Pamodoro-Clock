Halo
 
I created a simple timer app using react. I didn't use redux (which could be simpler approach) just because I wanted to play around with      CONTEXT API. So all the state and changes to state runs through context api.

You can just click on digits and change them and then press set to submit the changes. 

The turns to red 10 seconds to time up. 

When time is up it ring a bell. It runs just once, which is maybe not ideal solution for real world timers, but it is just practice piece so I wanted it to be less annoying. 

Cheers
